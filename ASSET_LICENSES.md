## Custom Assets

No shortlisted free hydraulic support or double-drum shearer met the combined realism, download, license, and Web-performance requirements. The current scene therefore uses original project geometry for the powered roof supports, double-drum shearer, face conveyor, narrow-gauge train, mine carts, worker, CCTV, ventilation ducting, pipework, roof bolts, and steel ribs. These parts are authored in `js/scene/photoreal-mine.js` from extruded profiles, rounded industrial housings, tubes, fasteners, and articulated groups; their PBR surface response uses the CC0 texture sets listed above.

The original geometry contains no extracted TaiChi/AirCity data, Sketchfab viewer cache, or third-party model mesh. If an official Sketchfab archive is later added, its author, license, download date, original format, and project modifications must be recorded here before release.
